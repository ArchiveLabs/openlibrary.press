# OpenLibrary.press

Open Library Press is an experimental, open source, non-profit publishing platform designed to help indepedent authors self-publish, promote, and sell their digital books.

Inspired by the philosophies of openlibrary.org, Open Library Press asks: what might it look like if there was an open source infrastructure that bridged the gap between independent authors and their audiences; securing more rights for readers and more equitably distributing proceeds to creators?

# Installation
